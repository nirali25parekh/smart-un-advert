    % stepscale - step-size to increment scales
    % xvote - stores the column idx of the position of first 100 highest

    % yvote - stores the row idx of the position of first 100 highest
    %         voted pixels

    %           highest voted pixels
    % voteang - stores the orientation of first 100 highest voted pixels
